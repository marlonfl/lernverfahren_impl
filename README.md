# lernverfahren_impl
Rudimentary implementations of algorithms presented in an ML class I take
Simply for my personal understanding

**Implemented so far:**
- k-Means (Clustering)

**To be implemented:**
- Gaussian Mixture Models Clustering
- DBSCAN (Clustering)
- k-Nearest-Neighbors (Classification)
- Naive Bayes (Classification)
- Logistic Regression (Classification)
- Linear Regression using Gradient Descent (Regression)
- (Ridge Regression)
- Decision Tree & Random Forest (Classification)
- SVMs (Regression + Classification)
- Fully Connected Neural Network (Regression + Classification)
